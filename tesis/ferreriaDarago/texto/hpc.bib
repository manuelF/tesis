	abstract = "Computational grids process large, computationally intensive problems on small data sets. In contrast, data grids process large computational problems that in turn require evaluating, mining and producing large amounts of data. Replication, creating geographically disparate identical copies of data, is regarded as one of the major optimization techniques for reducing data access costs. In this paper, several replication algorithms are discussed. These algorithms were studied using the Grid simulator: OptorSim. OptorSim provides a modular framework within which optimization strategies can be studied under different Grid configurations. The goal is to explore the stability and transient behaviour of selected optimization techniques. We detail the design and implementation of OptorSim and analyze various replication algorithms based on different Grid workloads.",

Identifying key trends with a grace and candor rarely encountered in a single work, the authors describe an evolutionary past drawn from their vast experience and project an enticing and compelling vision of HPC's future. Yet, the underlying assumptions implicit in their treatment, particularly those related to terminology and dominant trends, conflict with our own experience, common practices, and shared view of HPCs future directions. Taken from our vantage points of the Top500 list,''the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory NERSC computer center, Beowulf-class computing, and research in petaflops-scale computing architectures, we offer an alternate perspective on several key issues in the form of a constructive counterpoint. One objective of this article is to restore the strength and value of the term '' 
cluster'' by degeneralizing its applicability to a restricted subset of parallel computers. We'll further consider this class in conjunction with its complementing terms constellation, Beowulf class, and massively parallel processing systems (MPPs), based on the classification used by the Top500 list, which has tracked the HPC field for more than a decade.",

Our model captures the time-varying utilization of shared inter-cluster network resources in the grid. We compare our dynamic model with previous research that utilizes a fixed execution time penalty for co-allocated jobs. We have found that the fixed penalty model is more generous in its prediction of job turnaround time than our dynamic communication model. Additionally, we see that the penalty co-allocated jobs may experience without causing a severe performance degradation decreases as the number of clusters increases.",

One important component of that workload is the raw grid itself: an annotated graph representing the network topology and the hardware and software available on each node and link within it. GridG is an extensible synthetic generator of such graphs that is implemented as a series of transformations on a common graph format. The paper provides a definition of and requirements for grid generation. We then describe the GridG process in two steps: topology generation and annotation. For topology generation, we have both a model and a mechanism. We leverage Tiers, an existing tool commonly used in the networking community, but we extend it to produce graphs that conform to recently discovered power laws of Internet topology. We also contribute to the theory of network topology by pointing out a contradiction between two laws, and proposing a new version of one of them. For annotation, we have developed a mechanism, 
the requirements for a model, and identified the open problem of characterizing the distribution and correlation of hardware and software resources on the network.",

	abstract = "As deployed Grids increase from 10s to 1000s of nodes, the construction of an efficient and scalable information system is a key issue, as it is vital for providing querying and discovery services. Today most Grids adopt a centralized or hierarchical model for their information system, but this model is characterized by poor scalability, resiliency and load-balancing features. Nowadays the research and development community is heading towards the use of scalable information systems based on distributed models such as the decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) model and the super-peer model. If the former is adopted, each node can act both as a client and a server as it can generate discovery requests and also respond to requests issued by other peers. Requests and responses are forwarded with a hop-by-hop mechanism by ad hoc Grid Services hosted by Grid nodes. The super-peer model is a recently proposed approach that combines features of centralized and P2P models. A super-peer acts as a server for a 
single Grid organization, and publishes metadata describing the resources provided by the nodes of that organization. At the same time, super-peers connect to each other to form a P2P network at a higher level. This paper analyzes information systems based on three alternative models: the hierarchical, the decentralized P2P, and the super-peer model. A performance evaluation of such models is reported, and afterwards a performance comparison is discussed in order to analyze the pros and cons of each solution.",

They are responsible for collecting and distributing infor mation about resource availability and status to users: the quality of these data may have a strong impact on scheduling algorithms and over all performance. Many popular information services have a centralized structure. This clearly introduces problems related to information updating and fault tolerance. Also, in very large configurations, scalability may be an issue. In this work, we present a Grid Information Service based on the peer-to-peer technology. Our system offers a fast propagation of information and has high scalability and reliability. We implemented our system complying to the OGSA standard using the Globus Toolkit 3. Our system can run on Linux and Windows systems, with different network configurations, so to trade off between redundancy (reliability) and cost.",

	abstract = "While there have been several proposals of high-performance global computing systems, scheduling schemes for the systems have not been well investigated. The reason is difficulties of evaluation by large-scale benchmarks with reproducible results. Our Bricks performance evaluation system allows the analysis and comparison of various scheduling schemes in a typical high-performance global computing setting. Bricks can simulate various behaviors of global computing systems, especially the behavior of networks and resource scheduling algorithms. Moreover, Bricks is partitioned into components such that not only can its constituents be replaced to simulate various different system algorithms, but it also allows the incorporation of existing global computing components via its foreign interface. To test the validity of the latter characteristics, we incorporated the NWS (Network Weather Service) system, which monitors and forecasts global computing systems behavior. Experiments were conducted by 
running NWS under a real environment versus a Bricks-simulated environment, given the observed parameters of the real environment. We observed that Bricks behaved in the same manner as the real environment, and NWS also behaved similarly, making quite comparative forecasts under both environments",

@article{Trunfio2007,
	abstract = "Resource location or discovery is a key issue for Grid systems in which applications are composed of hardware and software resources that need to be located. Classical approaches to Grid resource location are either centralized or hierarchical and will prove inefficient as the scale of Grid systems rapidly increases. On the other hand, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) paradigm emerged as a successful model that achieves scalability in distributed systems. One possibility would be to borrow existing methods from the P2P paradigm and to adopt them to Grid systems taking into consideration the existing differences. Several such attempts have been made during the last couple of years. This paper aims to serve as a review of the most promising Grid systems that use P2P techniques to facilitate resource discovery in order to perform a qualitative comparison of the existing approaches and to draw conclusions about their advantages and weaknesses. Future research directions are also discussed.",

@inproceedings{Yang2003,
	abstract = "A super-peer is a node in a peer-to-peer network that operates both as a server to a set of clients, and as an equal in a network of super-peers. Super-peer networks strike a balance between the inherent ef?ciency of centralized search, and the autonomy, load balancing and robustness to attacks provided by distributed search. Furthermore, they take advantage of the heterogeneity of capabilities (e.g., bandwidth, processing power) across peers, which recent studies have shown to be enormous. Hence, new and old P2P systems like KaZaA and Gnutella are adopting super-peers in their design. Despite their growing popularity, the behavior of super-peer networks is not well understood. For example, what are the potential drawbacks of super-peer networks? How can super-peers be made more reliable? How many clients should a super-peer take on to maximize ef?ciency? In this paper we examine super-peer networks in detail, gaining an understanding of their fundamental characteristics and performance 
tradeoffs. We also present practical guidelines and a general procedure for the design of an ef?cient super-peer network.",
